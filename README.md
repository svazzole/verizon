# Verizon
Can you imagine missing out on the GitHub fun? Mastering GitHub and Git is an absolute must for any programmer.

Git, the powerhouse behind GitHub, is a game-changer as a version control system, saving valuable time in the software community. Personally, GitHub has made my coding life a breeze. Intrigued by its inner workings, I took the plunge, armed with tutorials and fueled by coffee, to craft my version of Git - and I playfully named it Verizon. Verizon is a simple version control system, implemented from scratch and spelled out.

I've got you covered on all the GitHub goodies you love - init, add, rm, status, commit, log, and more.

## Contributions
Please help me make this product into something awesome. Some work which needs to be done :
- Making different `Exception` classes for different use cases.
- Making some most commonly used functions as `lambdas` or `decorators`.
- Testing on Linux, and trying alternative(making a powershell version maybe?) for Windows.
- Making a small hosting system using *Verizon*.
- Writing strong and easy to understand documentation.

Create a PR and then we'll discuss further !
